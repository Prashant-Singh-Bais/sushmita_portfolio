        <p>Our client is an EdTech platform that helps educators and students to employ generative AI in school essay writing. Their ethos has been to embrace the technology in the right way, rather than ban it. </p>
        <p>Our brief was to design a student-side writing experience, that would complement the existing teacher-side evaluating experience.</p>
        <p>The project was scoped as a 5-week sprint. Our plan of action -</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment with Gen AI capabilities</li>
            <li>Brainstorm feature ideas</li>

        <p>We created 7 sacrificial concepts that enhanced the student writing experience <strong>but did not replace their process of thinking</strong> through an essay. Concepts revolved around - </p>

            <li>Getting started & Finding the right topic</li>
            <li>Planning the essay with research & analysis</li>
