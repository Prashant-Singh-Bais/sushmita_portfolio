        <p>Our client is an EdTech platform that helps educators and students to employ generative AI in school essay writing. Their ethos has been to embrace the technology in the right way, rather than ban it. </p>
        <p>Our brief was to design a student-side writing experience, that would complement the existing teacher-side evaluating experience.</p>
        <img src={img_1} alt=""/>
        <p>The project was scoped as a 5-week sprint. Our plan of action -</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Experiment with Gen AI capabilities</li>
            <li>Brainstorm feature ideas</li>
            <li>Design and conduct student interviews around sacrificial concepts</li>

        <p>Leveraging playfulness in the experience was a key factor. Multiple gamified experiences that utilize Gen AI to create humor and intentional-randomness were designed. So key use-cases - warm up games, an ad-lib prompter, finding relevant POVs to write about and reflect on tonality.</p>
